# Blackwell Electronics

Blackwell Electronics is a mock consumer electronics retailer with both bricks & mortar stores in the southeastern United States and an e-Commerce site. To help the management of this company to gain insight into their customers' purchasing behaviors, I applied data mining methods to develop predictive models in R.

Firstly, I implemented classifier C5.0 and Random Forest to predict customer brand preference. Secondly, I applied Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and GBM Regression model to predict volume of new products. Thirdly, I used the Aprior unsupervised learning algorithm to perform a market basket analysis on the transactions data and obtained insightful association rules.
